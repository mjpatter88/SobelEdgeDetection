An implementation in C of the Sobel edge detection operator on image files.  Written for my CprE 584 class.

Start with this link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator

Current Plan:
2)Add support for sizes more than 3 bytes, test on huge images?
3)Check all TODO's in the file.
4)Add to wiki a section on the initial software implementation, include screenshot comparison with gimp sobel operator.
5)Email group
6)Make optimizations to software (adders? shifts?)
7)Add to wiki a section on the optimizations with screenshots showing functionality

8)Profile software and add to wiki
9)Start a software implementation
10)Hardware implementation
