An implementation in C of the Sobel edge detection operator on image files.  Written for my CprE 584 class.

Start with this link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator

Current Plan:
1)Clean up software implementation (header file and library, simplify main method, etc.)
2)Add support for sizes more than 3 bytes, test on huge images?
3)Add to wiki a section on the initial software implementation, include screenshot comparison with gimp sobel operator.
4)Make optimizations to software (adders? shifts?)
5)Add to wiki a section on the optimizations with screenshots showing functionality

6)Profile software and add to wiki
7)Start a software implementation
8)Hardware implementation
